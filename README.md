## MSR Hackaton Projects

This repository contains Python challenge programs created for the MSR (Masters in Science in Robotics) Hackathon experience over a course of three days. The purpose of this challenge was not only to enhance skills in Python by solving challenging problems, but also to practice use in Git to prepare for an excing year in the MSR program. A brief description of each challenge and the developed code is shown below:

### **Challenge 1**:
 * The instructions for this challenge are outlined [here](http://robotics.mech.northwestern.edu/~jarvis/hackathon_2018_site/public/docs/challenge1.pdf). In summary, a Python program is to be written to return a message indicating number of lights on following a series of events for which two people either turn on/off a series of lights. See the [Light Puzzler](https://github.com/vnoelifant/my_projects/blob/master/Light_Puzzler.py) code which outputs a message indicating the number of lights and demonstrates ability to run program in the command line. 

### **Challenge 2**:
 * The instructions for this challenge are outlined [here](http://robotics.mech.northwestern.edu/~jarvis/hackathon_2018_site/public/docs/challenge2.pdf). In summary, a Python program, based on the Collatz Conjecture Algorith, analyzes the first one million natural numbers (i.e. 1,2,3,. . . )and finds the integer with the longest sequence.  See the [Collatz Conjecture](https://github.com/vnoelifant/my_projects/blob/master/Light_Puzzler.py) code that demonstrates this algorithm. 

### **Challenge 3**:
 * The instructions for this challenge are outlined [here](http://robotics.mech.northwestern.edu/~jarvis/hackathon_2018_site/public/docs/challenge3.pdf). In summary, this is a challenge borrowed from Googleâ€™s Python class, which for which the instructions are as follows: Write a program to parse the Alice in Wonderland novel text [here](http://robotics.mech.northwestern.edu/~jarvis/alice.txt) and returns the the count for each word and the top 20 most common words. See the [Alice Word Count](http://robotics.mech.northwestern.edu/~jarvis/hackathon_2018_site/public/docs/challenge3.pdf) code that solves this problem. 

### **RRT Programming Challenge**:
 * The instructions for this challenge are outlined [here](http://robotics.mech.northwestern.edu/~jarvis/hackathon_2018_site/challenge_rrt.html). In summary, this Python program demonstrates the use of the A Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree (RRT), one of the most important tools used in robotic path planning. An RRT is an algorithm that guarantees rapid exploration of some vector space. Demonstration of a simple RRT is implemented in this [RRT](https://github.com/vnoelifant/my_projects/blob/master/RRT_Challenge.py) code.
